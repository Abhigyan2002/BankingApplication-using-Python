# BankingApplication-using-Python
This is a simple Banking Appliation created using Python with interactive UI
---NOTE---

For successful execution and operation of the application,
two .txt files (which are already provided with name 
EmployeeDatabase.txt and UserDatabase.txt) have to be kept 
within the same folder where the code is, or atleast two 
blank .txt files have to be there with the same exact name before 
executing the program.

---Thank You---
